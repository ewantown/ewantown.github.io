* Welcome!

I'm Ewan ("you-win") and this site contains details about myself, my employment and projects, and some writings about computing and analytic philosophy.

I currently reside in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver][Vancouver]], British Columbia, and am employed as a software developer by [[https://www.worksafebc.com/en][WorkSafeBC]]. My workdays consist of building REST APIs and event-driven architecture to connect a Java monolith with various C# microservices. If that doesn't excite you, I spend most evenings at a little nonprofit [[https://www.eastsideboxingclub.com/][boxing gym]], and snow permitting, my weekends on the slopes of [[https://agnarchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Winter-Dual-Mountain-Village-Evening-Bluebird-Lights-DavidMcColm-26390.jpg][Whistler]].

Roughly, I studied "cognitive science", with forays into other arenas, before settling into a career making software. My education incorporated social and cognitive anthropology, analytic philosophy, and computer science. The uniting thread: a core fascination with symbolic activity, which today manifests mostly in my thinking about programming language theory and combinatorial search problems.
