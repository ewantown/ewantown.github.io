* Welcome!

You've landed at my place on the web. This site contains details about myself, my employment and projects, and some writings about life, the universe, and everything - but mostly just technology and (analytic) philosophy.

I'm currently living in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, and employed as a software developer by WorkSafeBC. My workdays consist of building REST APIs and event-driven architecture to connect a Java monolith with various C# microservices running in "the cloud". In case that doesn't excite you, I spend most evenings at a lovely little nonprofit boxing gym, and snow permitting, my weekends on the slopes of Whistler.

I have an eclectic educational background, stretching from social and cognitive anthropology to analytic philosophy and computer science. In a word, I studied "cognitive science", with numerous forays into other arenas, before settling into a career making software. Uniting all of these interests is a long-standing fascination with all forms of symbolic activity, which today manifests mostly clearly in my thinking about programming language theory and combinatorial search problems.

For a bit more about me, the person, and about this site, head to the [[./about.org][About]] page. For information about various bits of software I've made, check out the [[./projects.org][Projects]] pages. Finally, for my thoughts on all sorts of stuff, visit my [[./ramblings.org][Ramblings]].
