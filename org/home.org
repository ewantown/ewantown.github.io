* Welcome!

I'm Ewan ("you-win") and this site is my home on the web.

I currently reside in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver][Vancouver]], British Columbia, and am employed as a software engineer by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture][Accenture]]. My workdays consist of designing and building high-volume claims management systems, primarily for government entities. If that doesn't excite you, I spend most evenings at a little nonprofit [[https://www.eastsideboxingclub.com/][boxing gym]], and snow permitting, my weekends on the slopes of [[https://agnarchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Winter-Dual-Mountain-Village-Evening-Bluebird-Lights-DavidMcColm-26390.jpg][Whistler]].

Roughly, I studied "cognitive science", with forays into other arenas, before settling into a career making software. My education tied together social and cognitive anthropology, analytic philosophy, and computer science. The uniting thread is an interest in symbolic activity, which today manifests mostly in my thinking about programming language theory and combinatorial search problems.

For more on me, head to [[file:about.org][About]]. For information about things I've made, including the Emacs package that generated this website, check out [[file:projects.org][Projects]]. For my take on various topics, see [[file:thoughts.org][Thoughts]].
